### "What Sez prefixes, whence Sez the right to extend her petit subjectivity"
Here is Sezr-*anything*, or colloquially Sez! Sez is a 17yo trans girl 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️ and an upcoming Pure Math Undergrad at Homerton College, U. of Cambridge (2022 offer holder).

### Sez !
✨ Sez loves stuffs that go beyond the existence and triggers Sez's hermeticism and mysticism stimulator. 

✨ A strong convention of Theology, Phenomenology, Psychoanalysis and other wacky philosophical fields has **been exerting** on Sez.

✨ Sez has been digging on some **categorical and categorial** stuffs for sezr times and currently is Sez trying to explore some cringe Type Theor*ies*.
